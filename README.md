# Hands-On Unsupervised Learning with Python [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Unsupervised Learning with Python [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-unsupervised-learning-python-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788992855), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Use Unsupervised Learning tools like Market Basket Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, and Clustering algorithms to discover and extract hidden yet valuable structure in your customer data. Start by building your own recommendation engine using association rules that result from market basket analysis. Extract informative signals from noisy data using principal component analysis. Capitalize on the ability of cluster algorithms to identify natural groupings of your data to optimize, for instance, the targeting of your marketing efforts.

After watching this course and experimenting with the provided code, you will have required the requisite skills to apply key principles of Unsupervised Learning using Python.
